## 🔁 Release Workflow (Automated Scripts)

This repo includes helper scripts to automate release + Docker publishing.

| Order | Script                  | Purpose |
|------|-------------------------|---------|
| 1️⃣ | `release-mvn-to-git.sh` | Executes Maven release to bump version, tag repo, and build JAR — then triggers Docker build + push |
| 2️⃣ | `build-docker-image.sh` | Builds Docker image using the latest fat JAR |
| 3️⃣ | `push-docker-image.sh`  | Pushes tagged Docker image(s) to Docker Hub |

All run automatically by:
```bash
./release.sh
```

---

## ⚠️ full-reset.sh — Emergency Use Only

Use this script when Maven release fails mid-process and the repo becomes messy.

It:
- Resets repo to `origin/main`
- Deletes untracked files + release leftovers
- Removes `target/`
- Restores clean working state

Run carefully — it **wipes local changes**:
```bash
./full-reset.sh
```

## 📌 Status

This is a **research prototype** — design, API, and data model may change rapidly.
